/**
 * =========================================================================================================
 * Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
 * a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
 * permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
 * dictionary words.
 * <p>
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: Tact Coa
 * Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atco etaÂ·; etc.)
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * What does it take to be able to write a set of characters the same way forwards and backwards? We need to
 * have an even number of almost all characters, so that half can be on one side and half can be on the other
 * side. At most one character (the middle character) can have an odd count.
 * For example, we know "tactcoapapa" is a permutation of a palindrome because it has two Ts, four As, two
 * Cs, two Ps, and one 0. That O would be the center of all possible palindromes.
 * ==========================================================================================================
 * A palindrome is a string that is the same forwards and backwards.
 * Therefore, to decide if a string is a permutation
 * of a palindrome, we need to know if it can be written such that it's the same forwards and backwards
